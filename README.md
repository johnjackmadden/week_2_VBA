# VBA Challenge


## Overview of Project

The overview of this specific project was to determine trends in stock market data throughout the years in order to best predict what stocks to invest in. We looked across 12 specific stocks during the years of 2017 and 2018 to track their total daily volume and their % return by the end of the year. Using this data we could look for trends in order to maximize our return on an initial investment.

### Purpose

The main purpose of this exercise was to understand and apply basic computer science theory to a practical application for use to learn how multiple systems work together to output a finished project. We learned how to use conditionals, loops, and other skills to help build a base of computer science knowledge to be applied to future projects and coding languages.

### Results

The data tables shown displays 12 stock tickers that were tracked throughout the year of 2017 and recording metrics such as its opening price, the highest and lowest price of the day, the close price and the adjusted close), and finally the total volume of stock that was traded on that specific day. All of this data was then processed through a VBA script to record the total daily volume of the 12 stocks, and the total return they had by the end of the year.

The data shown for the year 2017 shows pretty strong performance all around. TERP was the only stock to go negative, and several stocks including DQ, ENPH, FSLR, and SEDG had over a 100% return compared to the beginning of the year.

Compared to 2017, 2018 was a much weaker stand alone year for the stocks we tracked. The only stocks to have a positive return were ENPH and RUN at over 80%, which is fairly strong. The losses for the other 10 stocks range from a low of -3.5% down to -60%.



## Summary

Advantages/Disadvantages of Using refactored code

Overall when the refactored code is compared to the original code, both do their job and correctly provide the same information for both methods. Using refactored code can provide benefits such as increasing the speed of an operation, or simplifying a code to be easier to read for a third party. Realistically though in a real-world situation if there are looming deadlines or have "code debt" sometimes it may not be viable to refactor all the code you are working on as long as you have a working solution, and might need to prioritize certain changes that need to be made while leaving others behind.

Advantages/Disadvantages of VBscript

For this project, our main goal was to turn our main VBA script that was worked on throughout the module into a more efficient and readable version for submission, while retaining functionality. The advantages and disadvantages of the refactored script echo some of statements I made earlier in my general statements. On one hand, my script ran faster and I learned a lot about computer logic and scripting priority by struggling through this project, which gave me a much deeper understanding of the process and bigger picture of the role of computer science in data analytics. However, I will say a disadvantage is the long term benefits of learning specific VBA syntax and formatting, since moving forward I don't believe we will be using syntax such as "diming" variables and other VBA specific language.
